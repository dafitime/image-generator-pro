Image Flow is a professional desktop application for organizing and tagging large image collections.
Built with Python and PyQt6, it provides:

AI‑powered scene detection and auto‑tagging (using ONNX models)

Portable catalogs (.iocat files) that can be shared via cloud storage – no server required

Persistent tags & custom filenames – saved instantly and synced across teams

Explorer‑style gallery with dynamic grid layout and instant search by tag/filename

Undo/redo history for all metadata changes

Multi‑user ready – multiple people can edit the same catalog (last‑write‑wins)

Perfect for photographers, designers, and teams who need to find images fast without complex DAM systems.#
